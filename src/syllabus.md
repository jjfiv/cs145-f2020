## Course Topics

This is an introductory computer science class and ***no prior experience is expected or required***. It is one of a few different entry points (CS105, CS150) into the CS major. We will do a lot of programming, and you will learn and practice a fair amount of Python, but this is an introduction to computer science, not a "Python" class. There is a lot of Python that we will not cover. Topics that we will cover include:

- Abstraction, algorithms, and program design
- Basic Python programming: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes
- Fundamental programming paradigms: functional, imperative, object-oriented
- Data representation and storage
- Computer architecture
- Program complexity
