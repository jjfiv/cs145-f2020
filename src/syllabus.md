## Course Topics

This is an introductory computer science class and ***no prior experience is expected or required***. It is one of a few different entry points (CS105, CS150) into the CS major. We will do a lot of programming, and you will learn and practice a fair amount of Python, but this is an introduction to computer science, not a "Python" class. There is a lot of Python that we will not cover. Topics that we will cover include:

- Abstraction, algorithms, and program design
- Basic Python programming: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes
- Fundamental programming paradigms: functional, imperative, object-oriented
- Data representation and storage
- Computer architecture
- Program complexity

## Readings & Homework

### Readings/Textbook: Think Python

We will be reading primarily from the free ***Think Python Textbook*** which is available both as an [Online Web Page](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) and as a [downloadable PDF](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf). I have a paper copy, but you do not need to purchase a copy unless you prefer to read a physical book.

#### Inclusivity in Think Python

While the content and ordering of this textbook are both great, the examples leave much to be desired -- nearly every single example is drawn from the comedy routines of the British surrealist comedians "[Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)" ...

To someone who's never seen any of their material (like me, the instructor!) that means their examples are often filled with gibberish that I don't find particularly helpful or funny.

I will be supplementing the readings from this book with our own examples and alternate exercises.

### Reading is not enough for Learning: Homework

I will often be comparing this course to a foreign language course. Learning about computers via a computer language like Python is quite similar to learning a second or third language; if you do not read, write, and speak the language, it will be difficult to make sense of concepts or to get the ideas to stick in your head.

To guide and demonstrate good learning practice, each of our readings will be accompanied by a handful of (mostly) multiple choice questions. These questions will be more difficult than those designed for exams, because the goal of them is to drive experimentation and discussion, rather than to check knowledge. I will freely discuss the correct answers to these questions in our synchronous labs, after which you will have the opportunity to update your answers.

I imagine that a successful strategy to learn from the homework & readings will be to:

1. Read the chapters and take some notes.
2. Attempt the "homework quizzes".
    - Try to assess your knowledge/notes: keep the book "closed". 
    - Guess on questions that ask "What does this code do?"
3. Use your experience of homework to guide your learning:
    - Re-read any sections on which you do not feel you know the correct answers.
    - Type in and run any code from the homework to verify whether your guesses are correct.
4. Review the homework again, updating your answers based on your closer reading.
5. Ask questions and share knowledge on Slack. 
    - I will be fairly quiet here (focusing on clarifications, and giving thumbs-up to good discussions).
6. Ask questions synchronously in lab.
7. "Perfect" your homework answers & notes after lab.

## Course Equipment & Software

### Zoom (emphasizing synchronous audio)

Our synchronous lab times will be conducted over Zoom, where we will occasionally use breakout rooms or share screens but we will focus on getting started with and having real-time discussions about the new assignments each week. It is likely Zoom will be required for many of your other courses.

Look for the Zoom link for your lab in your lab-channel on Slack!

### Slack

### Thonny

We will install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) - a program to help us learn to write Python in the first week and use it throughout the course. If you have any trouble getting this installed, reach out in Slack or in Tutoring hours.

### Logisim

Later in the course, we will explore how computers are constructed out of electrical logic gates and transistors. Logisim is software that will allow us to "build circuits" on our computers and test them. We will learn to use this software together, later in the course. 

## Course Structure

You are expected to attend our synchronous lab times each week. We will cover a lot of material asynchronously through the week (expect materials to be posted by Monday morning). We cover a lot of material each day and donâ€™t regurgitate the book(s). We'll post examples from class and any other media we use, but do not expect to be able to simulate the class by reading the materials posted online. 

### Weekly Assignment Dates

- Mondays - Readings & Homework: Video Content & Weekly "Quiz" will be made available so you can begin reading, discussing, and trying examples whenever you start every Monday.
- Wednesdays - Assignment Opens: The assignment for the week will be released by Wednesday -- if you feel comfortable with the readings for the week you may begin early.
- Thursdays/Fridays - Synchronous lab sessions are held via Zoom.
